// Base game hazard class
//
// This class really should be abstract (Java style), but Haxe does not support
// abstract classes in this sense. Therefore, subclasses must override:
//
// - AGameHazard.getHazard():IHazard
// - AGameHazard.beat():Void
// - AGameHazard.getPieces():Array<AGameSprite>
//
// The constructor for this class is private. This was done intentionally
// to prevent instantiation by classes other than subclasses (this is how
// "private" visibility works in Haxe
// [https://haxe.org/manual/class-field-visibility.html]).
